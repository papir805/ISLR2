# Porting code from ISLR

The book Introduction to Statistical Learning contains a wealth of information on machine learning algorithms, with labs and examples done in R.  Each chapter contains applied exercises performed on public datasets, which are meant to be performed in R as well, however many, if not all, of the labs or exercises can be done in Python.  

There are some great GitHub repositories that have already ported code from some of the labs to Python, as well as some repositories containing answers to the applied exercises in Python, however not everything has been ported over yet.  In particular, the second edition of ISLR was recently released (August 2021), which contained several new chapters not present in the first edition.

This repository contains code that I've ported over from R to Python, which reproduce results found in the labs and my own answers to the exercises.
